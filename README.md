This is a copy of the SRD 5.1 rule set published and released under the OGL 1.0A license. The System Reference Document community believes that it has the following rights regardless of any "deauthorization" efforts made by the licensor:

(1) continued copying and distribution of the licensed materials;
(2) continued copying and distribution of modified versions of licensed materials;
(3) creation, copying, and distribution of new modified versions of licensed materials.

Many open source licenses, such as the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) licenses, do not make use of the words "irrevocable" or “perpetual”. This does not materially affect the above stated rights. As such, the System Reference Document community believes that we retain these rights, regardless of any specific lack of words in the license.
